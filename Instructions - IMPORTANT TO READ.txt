Don´t ask any question if you don´t follow this Instructions.

1-Install python with pip installed, if you have already installed python and you don´t have pip (no sense xD) check this

2- use this:
		pip install pyautogui

		pip install psutil

		pip install Pillow

		pip install pyqt5


3-Now use this code to check the coords of your buttons, to run it
you have to open a cmd/power shell there and type python xy.py.
to stop it just press ctrl + c


(Before 4 and 5, if you have 1080, resolution skip 4 and 5)


4- Now you have the coords of cancel (when you leave a game and it says "the game still in progress") and you have a cancel button there, you checked that coords before with point 3, put it in the input.txt, in the first line(In case that its only one line, just enter the second line), it would be like that "1056 950" (without "" and of course this coords aren´t right (just random ones)).


5- Do the same in the second line but with the leave game coords when you die.


6- Open the Bot.exe, and select your screen resolution and press start.

The BPs that you will earn will be displayed in the cmd like "You have earned X BPs"

Before ask any question make sure to read this again, if you keep having it, just ask me on twitter or on github (I´m peleon02 in both sites)

I modded this bot to make it work and I will make more updates, as Cloxen, the main developer hasn´t got the enough time.

To update the bot use the update.exe

Ignore all "virus" that can tell your antivirus that it is, just pyinstaller compile like that the .exe you have the whole code <3
